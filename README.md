# :small_blue_diamond: Blue Badge Group API Project 

The Blue Badge API Project is a group project designed by Eleven Fifty Academy to evaluate students' progress in the Software Development program. The assignment was to build a .NET Framework API Web Application using n-tier architecture covering a topic of our group's choosing. The API needed to include at least one custom table per group member, with at least one of the tables implementing Foreign Key relationships.
